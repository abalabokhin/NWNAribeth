1.
Aribeth: Hel.....Hello..<CHARNAME>
<CHARNAME>: Aribeth!! How!!! What are you doing here? I saw you being taken away for execution?!?!
Aribeth: *Aribeth looks down at her feet, seemingly ashamed to meet your gaze. It was due to you you. Your words to Lord Nasher on my behalf swayed his judgment. 
Aribeth: Officially, I was beheaded in a non-public execution, but in truth, Lord Nasher offered to spare my life, on the condition that I'm never again seen in Neverwinter nor any lands under it's control.
Aribeth: I was to be taken to the city gates and set free, however, I instead made one final request. I asked that Lord Nasher have his  mage send me to the same place to which he was to return you.

<CHARNAME>: I'm happy to see you! GOTO 2
<CHARNAME>: I'm glad that you made it out alive. GOTO 3
<CHARNAME>: So you were able to avoid punishment for your crimes. GOTO 4

2.
Aribeth:*Smiles shyly* I'm... relived that you are pleased to see me again. I was afraid that you had come to detest me, for my actions."
<CHARNAME>: I could never.
Aribeth: It would be no less than what I deserve. I betrayed Tyr and my faith. I am nothing now, just a broken, fallen paladin.
<CHARNAME>: You made a mistake. A great one, but a mistake nonetheless. What is important is what you do now.
Aribeth: Then, I have a request. Please.. allow me to join you on  your travels. Perhaps by your side, I might find a measure of the peace that I once had. 

<CHARNAME>: I'd like nothing more than to have you with me. JoinParty, EXIT
<CHARNAME>: Perhaps now isn't the right time. Wait for me here. EXIT (Aribeth remains here)
<CHARNAME>: I have no need of you at this time. In the slums, there stands an inn called the Copper Coronet, await me there. I'll come find you if I should change my mind. EXIT (Aribeth goes to the Copper Coronet)

3. 
Aribeth: I'd hoped for a warmer greeting than that, but I understand that my turning up as I did must have been a shock. 
<CHARNAME>: Why did you follow me, again?
Aribeth: I have nothing now. No home. No family. No friends. You were the one person who was there for me through my ordeal, the one person who never gave up on me. I was hoping that you might find a place for me at your side? (Link to Dialog#5)

<CHARNAME>: I'd like nothing more than to have you with me. JoinParty, EXIT

Aribeth: Escape punishment!! I will never escape!! My prison has simply changed. Now, rather than being locked behind iron bars, I live in a cage of guilt and regret!! I will never forget the wrongs done to me and the horrors that I visited upon Neverwinter. I deserved to die for my crimes, but you had me spared. Why? If I am so deserving of judgment, why not just leave me to my wretched fate? Why did you speak on my behalf?
<CHARNAME>: You seemed repentant. GOTO 5
<CHARNAME>: I never said you didn't deserve to be punished, but that doesn't mean that I wanted to see you die. GOTO 6

5.
Aribeth: That is why is sought to follow you. As the one person who still believed that I was worth saving, I wanted to find you and pledge my sword to your cause. I'd hope that at your side, I could find some measure of redemption.
<CHARNAME>: Very well, you may join me. JoinParty, EXIT
<CHARNAME>: Give me some time to consider your proposal. Wait for me here. EXIT (Aribeth remains here)
<CHARNAME>: I have no need of you at this time. In the slums, there stands an inn called the Copper Coronet, await me there. I'll come find you if I should change my mind. EXIT (Aribeth goes to the Copper Coronet)

6.
Aribeth: Am I not being punished? Just because I'm not swinging from a gallows or languishing in a dungeon does not mean that I am not being punished. Now I am here, because of you. You are responsible for my presence here, in more ways than one. 
Aribeth: I have come here for a chance to fight by your side. Perhaps I was a fool, but I'd hoped that with your support and.... it matters not, but I had hoped that at your side, I could find my way back into the light.
Aribeth: So I ask, will you have me?

<CHARNAME>: Very well, you may join me. JoinParty, EXIT
<CHARNAME>: Give me some time to consider your proposal. Wait for me here. EXIT (Aribeth remains here)
<CHARNAME>: I have no need of you at this time. In the slums, there stands an inn called the Copper Coronet, await me there. I'll come find you if I should change my mind. EXIT (Aribeth goes to the Copper Coronet)

Aribeth: <CHARNAME>?
<CHARNAME>: Yes?
Aribeth: I wanted to thank you, once again. Not only for saving my life, but for pulling me back from the abyss. But I must admit to wondering why?
<CHARNAME>: You are important to me, of course I would do everything possible to save you. GOTO 8
<CHARNAME>: Your death would have served no purpose. Alive you could atone for your deeds. GOTO 9
<CHARNAME>: I had my reasons. Let's not discuss them any further. EXIT (No further dialog)

8.
Aribeth: I'm gladdened to hear you say that. If I might ask. The words shared between us back in Neverwinter, just prior to your final battle with Morag. Did you truly mean everything that you said? 
<CHARNAME>: Of course. I meant every word. GOTO 10
<CHARNAME>: My mind was on the upcoming battle, I can't seem to recall what was said between us. GOTO 11
<CHARNAME>: Truth be told, I was simply trying to offer you some comfort in your last hours. Nothing more. GOTO 12
<CHARNAME>: I must be a better actor than I thought if I was able to convince you of my sincerity. They were empty words, nothing more and I do not wish to continue this discussion. EXIT (No further dialog)

9.
Aribeth: So... the moment shared between us... it meant nothing to you?
<CHARNAME>: It meant something. I'm as of yet unsure as to just what it meant to me. GOTO 13
<CHARNAME>: I wouldn't say nothing. We both felt something, just not the same thing. Give it some time and perhaps we can find out together. GOTO 14
<CHARNAME>: Nothing? That sounds about right. EXIT (No further dialog)

10.
Aribeth: So, what happens now?
<CHARNAME> Now, we continue our journey together and we get to know one another better, if you wish to, that is?
Aribeth: I'd very much like that. EXIT GOTO 15

11.
Aribeth: We spoke words of friendship and affection! We spoke of mutual feelings that we shared and of what could have been, perhaps what could be between us. Why do you now claim to have no memory of that conversation? Was it just a game to you? Do I mean nothing to you?
<CHARNAME>: Forgive me. That was a cruel joke. Of course you mean a lot to me. I was simply curious as to how you remembered our conversation. GOTO 13
<CHARNAME>: It's no game, but are you positive that this is what you want? My path is one of darkness and danger. You've already seen much of both, this may be your last chance to find a measure of peace elsewhere? GOTO 14
<CHARNAME>: The last thing that I need is more drama in my life and having to deal with your baggage will be just one more unnecessary problem for me. EXIT (No further dialog)

12.
Aribeth: Then it seems that we have nothing more to discuss. EXIT (No further dialog)

13.
Aribeth: So... what does this mean... for us?
<CHARNAME>: What do you say to us taking it one day at a time?
Aribeth: *Nods* One day at a time, together. EXIT GOTO 15

<CHARNAME>: Aribeth! What's wrong?
Aribeth: It's nothing.
<CHARNAME>: I can see that you're crying! Please, let me help if I'm able?
Aribeth: I'm sorry. I was just remembering days gone by. Tell me. Do you ever think of people and places, now gone?

<CHARNAME>: Yes. I often think back on the past. Both to remember the happy times in my life and to reflect on those that I've lost. GOTO 16
<CHARNAME>: Occasionally. But memories of the past can be painful. I prefer to think of the future. GOTO 17
<CHARNAME>: Why! lamenting about things that have transpired is a waste of time. GOTO 18

16.
Aribeth: Would you tell me of your past?
<CHARNAME>: It's not a very interesting story. Most of my life was spent within the walls of Candlekeep with Imoen and my foster father, Gorion. He was murdered some time ago and I was thrust into the life of an adventurer. GOTO 19
<CHARNAME>: The cloistered walls of Candlekeep were my home for as long as I could remember. It was a stuffy place. When Gorion died I had no choice but to venture out into the world. GOTO 20
<CHARNAME>: Not much to tell, really. I lived in Candlekeep for as long as I had too and as soon as I got the chance to leave, I took it. GOTO 21

17.
Aribeth: There is some wisdom in that. It is not good for one to be overly attached to the past. But you can agree that memories of the past can bring comfort and teach valuable lessons, correct?
<CHARNAME>: You make a good point. GOTO 22
<CHARNAME>: I guess that I'd never really thought about it in that way. GOTO 23
<CHARNAME>: Perhaps, but I'm unsure as to whether that pain of remembering certain events is worth any potential learning’s. GOTO 24

18.
So you care nothing for your past? I find myself feeling somewhat sad for you. EXIT GOTO 25

19.
Aribeth: That tale is, sadly, repeated far too often and is eerily similar to my own. I'm sorry for your loss.
<CHARNAME>: Thank you, but I've come to terms with Gorion's death.
Aribeth: That's good to hear, for multiple reasons. It gives me hope that I too will be able to move on from..........
Aribeth: I'm sorry. I don't think that I can talk about this anymore. EXIT GOTO 25

20.
Aribeth: Candlekeep. It doesn't sound like such a bad place to grow up.
<CHARNAME>: It had it's charms, but I yearned for more. The forest in which you grew up sounds like an intriguing place. Do you miss it?
Aribeth: My home? I think of it sometimes. I....
Aribeth: I can't. Please may we speak of something else?
<CHARNAME>: Of course. I didn't mean to upset you.
Aribeth: No, it's not that. It's just.... never mind. Please let us continue on our way. EXIT GOTO 25

21.
Aribeth: You truly disliked it that much? Was there nothing good about your childhood there?
<CHARNAME>: Precious little. It was fun getting into trouble with Imoen, but most of those monks had sticks so far up their.....
Aribeth: No need to explain any further. I'm sure that I take your meaning!
<CHARNAME>: At any rate. It was too small a place for someone such as myself. It's much better now, being out in the world.
Aribeth: Well, it seems that we have differing ideas about the places from which we come. I guess that it's good that you don't seem to have any regrets. EXIT GOTO 25

22.
Aribeth: I'm glad to hear that you think so. Thank you for this. I feel somewhat better now. May we...speak again... about the people and places that shaped our lives. It's comforting to hear the stories of others.
<CHARNAME>: I'd be happy too.
Aribeth: Thank you. Now, let us be off. EXIT GOTO 25

23.
Aribeth: Well, maybe you should. There is always something to be learned.
<CHARNAME>: Especially from someone as wise as yourself.
Aribeth: ......
<CHARNAME>: I apologize, was that in poor taste.
Aribeth: *chuckles* No, it was just... unexpected. Thank you. I feel better for having spoken with you. I hope that this is the first of many such conversations. EXIT GOTO 25

24.
Aribeth: Life is risk, especially for an adventurer. Facing your past, the unpleasant parts even more so, is how one learns and grows. To deny that is to deny yourself. Why onetime Fen.......
<CHARNAME>: Aribeth?
Aribeth: I.... You actually may have a point. Perhaps some things from ones past are best left in the past. Let us speak of this no more. EXIT GOTO 25

Aribeth: *Aribeth notices you looking in her direction and quickly turns her head. You can tell that she's been crying again.* Please, don't look at me.
<CHARNAME>: You've been thinking of Fenthick again?
Aribeth: *nods* I've begun dreaming of him again. It isn't like before, though. Those dreams were terrifying. The dreams now, they just make me sad.
<CHARNAME>: In what way?
Aribeth: There's little to tell. When I dream, I'm never doing anything noteworthy. Sometimes I'm eating dinner, or training, or at a market. I look up and see Fenthick. He's watching me from across the room or from the other side
	of a street. He shakes his head when I notice him. He looks so.... disappointed. Each time, I attempt to reach him, but I always lose him within the crowd. I don't know what it is supposed to mean.
<CHARNAME>: Perhaps it is a vision. Fenthick could be trying to tell you something? GOTO 26
<CHARNAME>: I wouldn't read too much into it. You've been through a lot and are probably just in need of some real rest. GOTO 27
<CHARNAME>: I must admit that this is wearing thin? I swear, it's like Fenthick is a member of the party, given how much I hear his name lately. GOTO 28

26.
Aribeth: But what?
<CHARNAME>: It might be that he believes you have forsaken yourself. That you are not following your intended course? GOTO 29
<CHARNAME>: The expression that you read as disappointment could be something else. He might be trying to tell you that he is concerned for you? GOTO 30
<CHARNAME>: He obviously is disgusted by your weakness and constant drama. Try being stronger and not whining so much, that will help. GOTO 28

27.
Aribeth: But the dreams are so vivid. The feelings feel so real. To think that this could just be a simple dream. It must be more than that! It must!!
<CHARNAME>: It could just feel so real because you wish it to be so.
Aribeth: Do you really believe that that could be the explanation?
<CHARNAME>: It's not out of the realm of possibilities. You should think on it.
<CHARNAME>: Dream interpretation can be a tricky topic. Some turn out to be warnings. Some are manifestations of our deepest thoughts and some are just strange dreams that have no real meaning.
<CHARNAME>: I don't know and quite frankly, I'm tired of hearing about Fenthick all of the time. GOTO 28

28.
Aribeth: Well! I apologize that my pain is becoming such a burden. I'll ensure that you are troubled no further by it. EXIT (No further dialog)

29.
Aribeth: I'm sure that he would have been so dismayed by my actions. The fact that they were brought about by his fate would be an even greater source of disgust to him.
<CHARNAME>: I don't believe that dismay, nor disgust would be his reaction. He would, I think, be disappointed by you leaving the faith of Tyr. You spoke of all that you had to endure to find
	that path and to lose it is no small thing.
Aribeth: My fall? Could it be as simple as that?
<CHARNAME>: It's possible. He could be trying to tell you that you need to change. You need to atone in the eyes of Tyr.
Aribeth: I never considered this. Thank you for listening to me. I must think on this. EXIT GOTO 31

30.
Aribeth: I'm sure that he would have been so dismayed by my actions. The fact that they were brought about by his fate would be an even greater source of disgust to him.
<CHARNAME>: That is not the meaning that I had in mind.
Aribeth: Really? Then what?
<CHARNAME>: To see you in such sorrow. Mourning him, living your life under such a shadow. This is not the woman that he loved. I can't claim to have known him well, but my impression
	of him is that he isn't the type who'd want that for you. I believe that he'd want you to remember him fondly, and to do so while living your life to the fullest.
Aribeth: He doesn't despise me? Could he still be so concerned with my happiness?
<CHARNAME>: You both cared for one another. Its not hard to believe that he still cares for you in some way.
Aribeth: Oh Fenthick, you fool. Thank you <CHARNAME> you have given me much to think about. Thank you for your kindness. EXIT GOTO 31

Aribeth: I have reached a decision.
<CHARNAME>: A decision? About what?
Aribeth: I now see how weak I have become. I told myself that all I did was to avenge Fenthick, yet I see now that that was just an excuse. My attack on Neverwinter wasn't due to Fenthick's
	death, but to exact retribution for my own pain and sense of loss and betrayal. By doing so, I have dishonored his memory. It is time to let him go.
<CHARNAME>: I agree. GOTO 32
<CHARNAME>: That seems like a big step, can you do so? GOTO 33
<CHARNAME>: If that is your decision, then so be it. GOTO 34

32.
Aribeth: I'm aware that I've asked much of you recently. But your concern and support has been the strength that has gotten me through this dark time. Not only did your words save
	my life back in Neverwinter, but they have now stopped my descent into despair.
<CHARNAME>: No, you did that yourself.
Aribeth: That is kind of you to say, but I know the truth. Were it not for you, I'd have been doomed, but as long as I may remain at your side, I know that I will endure.
<CHARNAME>: You will always have a place here, with me. GOTO 35

33.
Aribeth: If you'd have asked a few days ago, I wouldn't be sure of my answer, but now, I can say, yes.
<CHARNAME>: That's good to hear.
Aribeth: It is because of you that I can say this, you know.
<CHARNAME>: I'm glad that I could be of help.
Aribeth: It's not just that. I find that I have come to rely upon you. Upon your support and guidance. With you at my side, I know that I can do this. I can move forward.
<CHARNAME>: I will always be here for you.
Aribeth: I know and you have no idea how comforting that is to me. Thank you. GOTO 35

34.
Aribeth: You are unsure of my choice?
<CHARNAME>: You have been indecisive as of late. While I agree that it is past time for your mourning to cease, I don't know if finally putting Fenthick's memory to rest will be the
	magic fix that you hope it to be.
Aribeth: What else should I do?
<CHARNAME>: That is not for me to say. I only suggest that you consider that you have more issues to resolve, other than your grief.
Aribeth: I....I see. I will.... be able to count on you....right? On your support?
<CHARNAME>: You may certainly count on my friendship.

<CHARNAME>: It shows.
Aribeth: I'm... pleased that you noticed. I'd begun to forget what it was like to have someone be concerned for me. It's nice to feel that once again.
<CHARNAME>: Well, I give you my word that I'll continue to watch over you.... and notice you.
Aribeth: *blushes slightly* Shush, you.
<CHARNAME>: Heh.
Aribeth: I do have something to ask you, though.
<CHARNAME>: Hmmmm?
Aribeth: There were rumors going around about you back in Neverwinter. I've also heard some of the others talking since I've joined your party. I need to ask, is it true? Are
	you one of the Bhaalspawn?
<CHARNAME>: I don't want to talk about it. GOTO 36
<CHARNAME>: Yes, I am one of Bhaal's children. GOTO 37
<CHARNAME>: No, that's merely an unfounded rumor, spread to tarnish my name. GOTO 38

36.
Aribeth: I can understand your reluctance to speak about such things. Just know, that as you were here for me, I will be here for you. Should you wish to talk, about anything,
	I will always listen.
<CHARNAME>: Thank you Aribeth. I'll keep that in mind. EXIT GOTO 39

37.
Aribeth: I'm somewhat surprise that you were able to admit this so easily.
<CHARNAME>: I trust you.
Aribeth: Just when I believe that nothing that you say could make me happier. I'm grateful for your trust. I imagine that it doesn't come easily.
<CHARNAME>: I've become accustomed to those who hate and fear me due to my lineage. But now I have a question.
Aribeth: Yes?
<CHARNAME>: Knowing what I am, do you now regret your choice to stay at my side? Do you now have any doubts? Do you secretly fear that I may turn on you some day?
Aribeth: Never! To my knowledge, you have never betrayed anyone, nor led a crusade against a vulnerable city. You've accepted me and my dark past. No one who could
	look past a stain such as that could ever harbor such ill intent. *Aribeth takes your hand in hers* I trust you completely.
<CHARNAME>: Thank you for your faith in me.
Aribeth: And thank you for YOUR faith in me. EXIT GOTO 39

38.
Aribeth: Do you still not trust me? I'd thought that with your acceptance of me into your company, that we could confide in each other. Was I mistaken?
<CHARNAME>: There are degrees of trust. Bhaalspawn are hated and feared. No matter what good deeds they may have done or how many people helped, children of Bhaal are hunted,
	driven out of their communities or imprisoned.
Aribeth: Do not forget, that I can relate to those experiences. Although my damnation has come at my own hands, rather than the circumstances of my birth. Just remember, as you've
	accepted me, flaws and all, I too accept you for who you are. Even if you may or may not be the child of a particular deceased God.

<CHARNAME>: When you lower your defenses, you suddenly become aware of any faults of deficiencies that you have and they feel as though they are blindingly obvious. How am I doing?
Aribeth: *looks down at the ground* Pretty well.
<CHARNAME>: So you find yourself doing whatever possible to either rectify those supposed faults, or bury them. All so that you can feel worthy of you intended. Does that about sum it up?
Aribeth: You just laid me bare like an open book. I'm unsure as to whether I should be happy that you know me as you do, or frightened that I can hide nothing from you?

Aribeth: See! That right there! I don't know how to respond that.
<CHARNAME>: Well, it's just a question. You don't have to respond to it if you'd rather not?
Aribeth: That's not it. It's just..... I never had a real relationship before I came to Neverwinter, until Fenthick. When I met him, he took the initiative, he pursued me. I didn't have to
	do anything. I didn't know what to do. I just leaned back and accepted his feelings. You and he are so different. You are very guarded, he wore his heart on his sleeve. I don't know 
	how to do a relationship where I have to play an active part, too.

Aribeth: What is happening?
Messenger of Lathander: You have taken the first step and now stand at a crossroads. But the choice to proceed is not yours alone.
Messenger of Lathander: *Turns to you*
Messenger of Lathander: <CHARNAME>, as a Judge of Lathander, you are once again called to render a verdict. Lady Aribeth has forces drawing her in differing directions. By setting foot upon this path, she WILL
	be changed. There is no way to escape this fate, save to not undertake the journey. This, Judge, is why you have been brought here. I ask you this question, is Lady Aribeth prepared for the challenge ahead?

Aribeth: Redemption? To once again become a paladin? Could such a thing be possible?
<CHARNAME>: Aribeth? Is that something that you want? To once again serve Tyr as a paladin?
Aribeth: The answer to that is complicated. I will admit that my heart yearns for the notion of being able to atone and regain what I've lost.

YOUR WORLD MAP HAS BEEN UPDATED.
Messenger of Lathander: Take this map. It will lead you to a fallen sanctuary once dedicated to Tyr Here, holy warriors once trained and purified themselves, but those within succumbed to temptation and
	lost their way. Now, their unclean spirits infest the halls. You will reclaim this place for Tyr and with that, you will reclaim your title as a paladin of Tyr. I have no more to say. EXIT

Aribeth: You want me to be... happy? I.... I'd not considered this before? While I had many rewarding experiences during my service to Tyr, it is also true that most on the strife that I endured came as a
	result of that service. I met Fenthick when I was a paladin, but his death was a direct result of my service to Neverwinter and Tyr. Is it possible? Once my need for revenge had faded, could I have

Ghostly Librarian: So, more fools, come to cleanse this place?
Aribeth: More fools? Others have come before us?
Ghostly Librarian: Of course, Fool. You are but another misguided sod, tricked into coming here for the glory of Tyr. You will meet the same fate as the others and soon enough, you will join the rest in their
	endless defense of these halls.
Aribeth: I will not be defeated so easily!
Ghostly Librarian: So said they all. Yet dead they are. Leave now and you may live a little longer.
Aribeth: I will not yield!
Ghostly Librarian: Sigh. Very well. Then I have no choice but to proceed with the test. Listen closely, you will be given 3 scenarios. Respond as you believe best.
Ghostly Librarian: Number One. You are a student. Every day you and your classmates see a bully tormenting another student, but no one tells the instructor. Do you speak up? 
Aribeth: Yes. It is the duty of the strong to defend those who cannot protect themselves. GOTO 88
Aribeth: No. If I were to intervene, the victim will not learn to stand up for themselves and fight their own battles. They will never grow and become stronger. GOTO 89

88.
Ghostly Librarian: And what will happen the next time? Someday, there will be no one to fight their battles for them. You would deny them a chance to learn to stand on their own? So be it. GOTO 90

89.
Ghostly Librarian: You would stand by and do nothing? Rationalize it all that you wish, but you are still allowing the strong to victimize the weak. GOTO 90

90.
Ghostly Librarian: Number Two. You witness a man steal money from a greedy, yet honest merchant. However, instead of keeping the money for himself, he donates it to a poor orphanage that can now afford to feed, clothe, and care 
	for its children. You know who committed the crime. The City Watch approaches you and ask if you know anything of the crime. If you reveal the information, there's a good chance the money will be returned to the 
	wealthy merchant, leaving a lot of kids in need. What do you do?
Aribeth: Turn the robber in to the authorities; theft, even for a good reason, is still wrong. GOTO 91
Aribeth: The merchant will not suffer from the loss. Say nothing since the money went to what you deem a good cause. GOTO 92

91.
Ghostly Librarian: So, to satisfy your own moral compass, you would allow the needy to suffer? Do you not find it selfish, causing suffering, just so that you may feel proud of yourself for doing whet you perceive to be the right thing? GOTO 93

92.
Ghostly Librarian: Who are you to judge the pain of others? Did not the merchant earn his coin through his own hard work and sweat, yet you feel that you have the right to decide that others are more worthy of his coin? 
	Do you appropriate the man's home to house the orphans? Do you tear the clothing from his back to clothe the poor? Where does it end? GOTO 93

93.
Ghostly Librarian: Number Three. A group of children was playing near a forked road. They were warned that one side was still in use and heavily traveled, thus very dangerous, while the other road was no longer used. One child, 
	recognizing that the in-use road was not safe, obeyed the warning and played on the unused road, the rest defied the warning and were playing on the road still being used. You notice that a heavily laden wagon has broken 
	loose and is rolling down the road, and you are just beside the road fork. You can make the wagon change its course to the unused road and save most of the kids. However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the 
	unused road would be killed. Do you divert the wagon or allow it to roll unchanged?
Aribeth: Do nothing. The boy playing alone should not be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was. GOTO 94
Aribeth: Divert the course of the wagon, and sacrifice only one child. It's sad, but better to save most of the children at the expense of only one child. GOTO 95

94.
Ghostly Librarian: So you allow 5 lives to be destroyed, simply to save 1? Perhaps you feel that their actions somehow make them deserving of death? Who are you to judge the worth of a life over another? Do not the needs of the many outweigh the needs
	of the few or the one? GOTO 96

95.
Ghostly Librarian: So, the boy who made the wise decision to stay out of danger is chosen to die, simply because his death is the lesser sacrifice? Did not the others place themselves, knowingly in danger? Does personal
	responsibility not have an effect on ones life? Do action not have consequences? GOTO 96

Ghostly Librarian: Hmmph. You have made your choices and now must live with them. Be on your way. EXIT GOTO 97

Demon: STOP!!! You have defeated me. Before you strike the final blow and end my existence, I would have you hear my offer.
Aribeth: Offer?
Demon: Yes. I sense that you once followed the being to whom this place once belonged. I also sense that you've followed another, darker master more recently.
Aribeth: What are you saying?
Demon: I offer you the chance to pledge yourself to my Master, Gra'zlteasu. He was once a minion of Behlefit, of whom your companion was once acquainted. My Master is in ascendance and is seeking capable servants. I offer you, 
	Aribeth, the opportunity to become one. You will know strength and power the likes you have never seen in His service.
Aribeth: I.... <CHARNAME>, what should I do?
<CHARNAME>: Don't do this Aribeth! You've come so far, worked so hard. Don't lose faith now when you are one step away from your goal. GOTO 98
<CHARNAME>: His offer is worth considering. You grew strong under Tyr, but did he truly do right by you? Was he there for you when you needed his support? Perhaps you should consider another path? GOTO 99

Aribeth: Another...path? After all that I've gone through, just abandon any hope of redemption?
<CHARNAME>: Redemption for what? Yes, you turned against Neverwinter and Tyr, but did they not turn against you first? Leading an army of conquest against the city was perhaps a bridge too far, but what had either Tyr or Neverwinter
	done to deserve your loyalty? Morag was untrustworthy, but have you considered finding a new patron? One who will help you realize your dreams and ambitions!
Aribeth: I...... I..... see now. Yes, <CHARNAME>,, you are correct. Why did I so desperately want to regain Tyr's favor? I don't need atonement! It should be them asking.. no begging me for my forgiveness! I will accept the power offered!

Aribeth: What is your meaning?
<CHARNAME>: This demon is an agent of evil and the one he serves undoubtedly more, I'd not bond myself to creatures such as they. Yet, the more I see of these so called tests to which you have been subjected, it makes me question
	the motives of Tyr and his followers. What does all of this have to do with proving yourself? If anything it only proves that you are a capable warrior, by that metric, my brother Sarevok, the black hearted villain that
	he was, could be judged worthy. It seems that you are simply being used to cleanse this place and do someone's dirty work for them. You don't need to ask anyone’s forgiveness. You are already strong. You have my love.
	Were I you, I'd wash my hands of them both; Tyr and the demon!

<CHARNAME>: Why would you think that?
Aribeth: I've seen you during an adventure. You are in your element. Even during times of hardship, you seem so happy to be out there, so.... complete.
<CHARNAME>: And you were afraid that I'd not want to leave that life?
Aribeth: Yes.
<CHARNAME>: I want to be with you. Being an adventurer is great, but there are very few old adventurers. One has to know when to leave that life behind and I want to build a life with you.
Aribeth: That makes me so happy to hear. Let us hurry and put an end to this. I can't wait to greet our new future. EXIT

122.
Aribeth: To travel and experience new things does sound pleasant. But for how long? One can't do so forever.
<CHARNAME>: We'll just take it day by day. I want you by my side for all of this. We'll continue until it's no longer fun, then, we'll find something new.
Aribeth: Just live day by day?
<CHARNAME>: Just the two of us. We'll take life as it comes.
Aribeth: I must admit, it does have it's appeal. Although the uncertainty is somewhat unsettling.
<CHARNAME>: Life is uncertainty. But together, we will triumph. EXIT
