1.
Aribeth: So, once more we find ourselves fighting for our lives. I'd thought that defeating Irenicus and clawing our way out of the Abyss would serve
	as a fitting capstone to our adventures. But it seems not.
<CHARNAME>: I'm sorry. Once again my lineage has put you at risk.
Aribeth: It is what it is. But it you about whom I worry, my love.
<CHARNAME>: Me?
Aribeth: To be hunted by such powerful foes, surely that weighs upon you?
<CHARNAME>: Not really. I'll crush any who oppose me and take their power for myself. GOTO 2
<CHARNAME>: It does, somewhat. But having you by my side does much to ease my troubled mind. GOTO 3
<CHARNAME>: What weighs on my mind is my fear that you could be injured or killed by someone attempting to get to me. If it means keeping you safe, my
	life is of no concern. GOTO 4

2.
Aribeth: I appreciate your faith in your abilities, but when I hear you speak of destroying your foes in that way, it scares me.
<CHARNAME>: Why is that?
Aribeth: You sound as though you are losing touch with your own humanity.
<CHARNAME>: Perhaps I'm simply growing beyond the limitations of my past?
Aribeth: I...want you to soar. I just ask that you don't leave me behind.
<CHARNAME>: Never! EXIT GOTO 5

3.
Aribeth: I'm happy that I can be here to support you for once. You've done so much for me and it's nice to be able to repay your kindness.
<CHARNAME>: You don't owe me any debt. But if you feel that there is something owed, I'd like to ask you to consider a request?
Aribeth: What do you need?
<CHARNAME>: Promise me. If it becomes too dangerous to be near me, that you will flee and save your own life.
Aribeth: ..... I know that this is coming from a place of concern, but that was an incredibly hurtful thing that you just said.
<CHARNAME>: What?
Aribeth: I want to be with you. I'm aware of the danger and I want to be here, regardless. I'll not desert you. Don't ask that of me again.
<CHARNAME>: I only....
Aribeth: DON"T ask again!
<CHARNAME>: Understood.
Aribeth: Good. Let us not speak of this again. EXIT GOTO 5

4.
Aribeth: Nothing that you've ever said has frightened me more than that statement.
<CHARNAME>: Huh? Why?
Aribeth: Your life is not worth less than mine. Don't you DARE think to try and trade your life for mine!
<CHARNAME>: I couldn't see myself going on if something happens to you.
Aribeth: Do you think that my pain would be any less if I had to go on without you? Especially if I knew that you had sacrificed yourself for me.
<CHARNAME>: I hadn't considered that.
Aribeth: I know.
<CHARNAME>: So, what now?
Aribeth: Simple. We both agree to face every threat that appears before us, conquer said threats and live a long life together.
<CHARNAME>: Oh! It's that simple is it?
Aribeth: Yes. I've decided that it will be that simple. Are you planning on arguing it with me?
<CHARNAME>: Heh heh. I'd not dream of it.
Aribeth: Good. Let's be on our way. EXIT GOTO 5

Aribeth: How tragic.
<CHARNAME>: In what way?
Aribeth: She raised Yaga Shura. She was basically his mother and he just used her and cast her aside. In spite of that, she still loved him.
<CHARNAME>: Inexplicable, is it not.
Aribeth: Do you believe it to be so? Can you not believe in the capacity to love someone so much that in spite of everything that they may do to you, you
	can't help but love them?
<CHARNAME>: No. I feel if that person really loves you, they would not visit any harm upon you. GOTO 6
<CHARNAME>: I guess if you love someone enough, you could forgive them anything. GOTO 7
<CHARNAME>: No. Some actions are unforgivable. No amount of love could repair that. GOTO 8

6.
Aribeth: Could there not be a situation in which one has no choice but to take an action that could be harmful to one they love?
<CHARNAME>: I can't believe that a situation such as that could arise. There is always another choice. It may not be a good choice, but if you sincerely
	love that person, you'll find a way. Even if it means that you must take the hit.
Aribeth: That is a very black and white perspective. However, with a sentiment such as that, I can take comfort fro the knowledge that you will 
	never betray me. EXIT GOTO 9

7.
Aribeth: It pleases me to hear you say that!
<CHARNAME>: For what reason? You aren't planning on hurting me, are you?
Aribeth: Sigh. Of course not my love... it's just....
<CHARNAME>: It's just?
Aribeth: You've never held my past against me, but in the recesses of my soul, I still have a lingering fear that one day, you may tire of the dark
	cloud that hangs above my head and leave me. Knowing that you believe in forgiving the ones you love brings me much peace of mind.
<CHARNAME>: You need not worry. We will always be together. EXIT GOTO 9

8.
Aribeth: As unmovable as ever, you are.
<CHARNAME>: I don't follow?
Aribeth: There is not much middle ground with you, is there? To believe that there are unforgivable acts, this leaves little room should something happen.
<CHARNAME>: That simply means that one should be mindful of those lines and be sure not to cross them. As long as the boundaries are clearly marked
	everyone knows where they should stand.
Aribeth: My love. Sometimes your determination is comforting, other times unsettling. EXIT GOTO 9

<CHARNAME>: Aribeth. Why do you look upon me with such sadness?
Aribeth: These trials to which you are being subjected.
<CHARNAME>: What of them?
Aribeth: They make me sad for you.
<CHARNAME>: Why?
Aribeth: You've been through so much. Gorion's death. Banished from your home. Repeatedly hunted and attacked. Tortured. Persecuted. Now to be
	subjected to these...tests at the whim of some being that claims to be preparing you. When will it end. When will you be allowed to rest?
	When will we find peace?
<CHARNAME>: Peace? I'm unsure if I believe in it anymore. GOTO 10
<CHARNAME>: I will know peace when I am strong enough to kill anyone who threatens me! Then I can rest. GOTO 11
<CHARNAME>: After each test, I become more powerful. I am eager to see just how far I can go. What can I become! The possibilities are incredible! GOTO 12

10.
Aribeth: Hold fast my love.
<CHARNAME>: To what?
Aribeth: To hope for the future. To the belief that this will end. To me! We will see this through. Together. EXIT GOTO 13

11.
Aribeth: Remember my love. You are not in this alone. You do not have to protect everyone on your own. As you protect me, I will protect you.
<CHARNAME>: I thank you, but this is my burden to bear.
Aribeth: Yes, but you need not bear it alone. You have me and our comrades. We will become stronger together. Together, we will win through. EXIT GOTO 13

12.
Aribeth: ..... Please my love! Do not go down that path!
<CHARNAME>: Pardon?
Aribeth: Speaking in that way. You talk as one who is leaving his humanity behind and doing so gladly. A road such as that is one that I can not walk
	with you and I couldn't bear to be left behind. Not again. You already begin to become distant.
<CHARNAME>: Aribeth?
Aribeth: Please, my love. When thought such as this cloud your mind, I beg you, think of me. Hold my love for you close and choose to stay with me. EXIT GOTO 13

Aribeth: Are you tired my love? You look exhausted.
<CHARNAME>: I'm all right.
Aribeth: Are you really? You seldom talk to me anymore.
<CHARNAME>: You don't need to worry.
Aribeth: I disagree. It is not only I. You don't speak to anyone. You barely sleep. I see you sitting up all night in a chair in the corner of the inn's
	taproom or staring into the fire at camp. Most would break under this weight, but you....
<CHARNAME>: What?
Aribeth: You are growing sharper. Harder. It's as if the unnecessary pieces of you are being cut away. Will I be one of those, someday?
<CHARNAME>: Of course not. Don't be ridiculous! GOTO 14
<CHARNAME>: I'd never do that. GOTO 15
<CHARNAME>: I'm... not sure how to answer. GOTO 16

14.
Aribeth: You've never before spoken to me that harshly.
<CHARNAME>: I'm sorry, I'm just tired.
Aribeth: It's more than that and you know it to be so. I'm losing you and it's killing me.
<CHARNAME>: No! You'll never lose me. We just need to finish this, then all will be well!
Aribeth: I hope so, my love. I so desperately want to believe that. EXIT GOTO 17

15.
Aribeth: There was a time when I would have never questioned that, but now....
<CHARNAME>: I'm sorry for making you worry.
Aribeth: I want to help you, but you've been pushing me away.
<CHARNAME>: I know, but it seems wrong to keep you too close. I don't want this shadow that clings to me to taint you as well. I just can't do that 
	to you.
Aribeth: My love...
<CHARNAME>: I will be ok. WE will be ok. Trust me.
Aribeth: I do. I will trust you to the end. EXIT GOTO 17

16.
Aribeth: How are you not able to answer?
<CHARNAME>: I tried to deny it, but you were tight. Something within me is changing. I no longer feel things the way that I once did. Other items
	that used to be so important, now matter less to me than before. I remember caring more, but now I do not. Is this what Irenicus experienced,
	I wonder?
Aribeth: *Pulls you into an embrace* My love. My poor lost love.
<CHARNAME>: *You slowly pull away* It's ok. It doesn't bother me.
Aribeth: That is why I'm so scared. I don't know what to do?
<CHARNAME>: There is nothing to be done. Our course is set. We must set it through. Let us hope that once we reach the other shore, we will still be
	somewhat the same people as we once were. EXIT GOTO 17.

Aribeth: Finally, the end draws near. Once we face Balthazar, this will be over.
<CHARNAME>: Perhaps not. Too many things are not adding up. I feel that Balthazar will be just another challenge to face.
Aribeth: Have you given up hope that this will end?
<CHARNAME>: It will never cease. There will always be another enemy. Another battle. GOTO 18
<CHARNAME>: I've accepted my doom and have made peace with it. GOTO 19
<CHARNAME>: It is becoming difficult to see any ray of hope, but I will try, for you. GOTO 20

18.
Aribeth: I refuse to believe that! I do see the light at the end of this tunnel. We will persevere.
<CHARNAME>: I wish that I had your faith. EXIT GOTO 21

19.
Aribeth: How can you say that with such calm?
<CHARNAME>: I once knew a man who had the ability to use curses to empower himself. I've realized, that I can feast upon my doom and use it to 
	draw strength. If I am destined to face an unending torrent of enemies, I will face then all and I will become stronger!
Aribeth: No! You can not just accept something such as this! Even if you plan to try and turn this to your advantage, the fatalism with which
	you stated your plan reeks of one who has resolved to meet his death with resolve, rather than defiance!
<CHARNAME>: Dear Aribeth. It's fine. Everything has become so clear.
Aribeth: .... So that's it? Have I lost you?
<CHARNAME>: I will always be here, in some form or another, my love. EXIT GOTO 21
