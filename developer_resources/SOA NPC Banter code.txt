== BNWARIBE~YOU DARE ASK ME THAT! YOU, WHO HAS....! I..... umm.... ENOUGH! Just stay away from me!~
== BANOMEN~Stay away? Ahhhh. I believe that I understand. Much of the troubles that befall Neverwinter were as a result of the machinations of Desther and the false Helmites.~
== BANOMEN~Surely, Lady Aribeth, you can not see a parallel between myself and those heretics?~
== BNWARIBE~I said, stay away from me!~
== BANOMEN  /* // TODO: make this only available if player is a cleric of Helm. */~I don't understand how you could possibly bear Helmites any ill will. For, is not your companion <CHARNAME> also a worshipper of Helm? You do not seem to cast any blame upon him.~
== BNWARIBE  /* // TODO: make this only available if player is a cleric of Helm. */~That is because <CHARNAME> has proven himself! While the other, so-called "faithful" of Helm allowed a serpent such as Desther to infiltrate the church!~
== BNWARIBE  /* // TODO: make this only available if player is a cleric of Helm. */~But, <CHARNAME> was not blinded by the arrogance or dogma of the church. He saw through the deception and acted! He ended this! He stopped Morag and her cult!~
== BANOMEN~Those false Helmites are just as much my enemies as yours....~
== BNWARIBE~False Helmites or FALLEN Helmites?~
== BANOMEN~What do you mean by that?~
== BNWARIBE~Desther and his fanatics appeared from nowhere. No one knew anything of them, yet they knew enough about the faith of Helm to impersonate Helmite priests.~
== BNWARIBE~How did they obtain this knowledge?~
== BNWARIBE~Was it simply through the torture and interrogation of captured Helm clergy, or were some, if not all, of them FORMER faithful of Helm that had defected to join the cult of Morag!~
== BANOMEN~Just, what are you insinuating!?!~
== BNWARIBE~That it is the church of Helm that is largely responsible for this! If Desther and his ilk were once Helmites, then what rot within the church led to their loss of faith?~
== BNWARIBE~Or, did Desther's acolytes learn everything necessary to impersonate a Helmite from their conquest of Helm's Hold?~
== BNWARIBE~If that is the explanation, how were they able to do so? How was Helm's hold taken so easily?~
== BNWARIBE~Were is defenders truly so weak that they could not defeat Desther? How were they able to occupy the Hold for so long without any of the true faithful noticing?~
== BNWARIBE~Why were the false Helmites permitted to operate in a cosmopolitan city such as Neverwinter, without ANY of Helm's priesthood discovering their ruse?~
== BNWARIBE~After ALL of these failures, can you still deny the fault that lies with the church?~
== BANOMEN~That is hardly a fair judgment to make.~
== BNWARIBE~Fair!!! The Vigilant One! The Watcher! The Great Guard! All of these are names by which Helm is known, are they not!~
== BNWARIBE~Yet, who amongst Helm's faithful noticed anything!?!~
== BNWARIBE~What Helmite stood guard over the people of Neverwinter?~
== BNWARIBE~Which follower of Helm defeated Desther!?! NONE of you, that's who! It fell to a ragtag mercenary like <CHARNAME> to answer the call.~
== BNWARIBE~<CHARNAME> was the one to expose Desther, disrupt his plot and re-take Helm's Hold.~
== BNWARIBE~Had you Helmites truly lived up to your deity’s name, it would have been a disciple of Helm that would have ended Desther's plot.~
== BNWARIBE~Had you Helmites not been so weak, Helm's Hold would not have been taken.~
== BNWARIBE~The Morag cultists would have never had the chance to come to Neverwinter. The Wailing Death would not have been released.~
== BNWARIBE~Desther would not have been able to deceive Fenthick and he wouldn't have..... have.....~

== BANOMEN~You must see that to lay blame at the feet of every disciple of Helm is unjust.~
== BNWARIBE~Unjust? You still refuse to acknowledge the Helmites fault in this?~
== BANOMEN~It could be argued that Helm's Hold fell due to the arrogance of the knights within. They could have underestimated their opponents or over estimated their own capabilities.~
== BANOMEN~However, there is just as much chance that Desther's forces truly were able to outmatch the defenders.~
== BANOMEN~But what of Neverwinter's role in this? The forces of Neverwinter must have had opportunities to uncover this plot?~

== BIMOEN~I worry that having you around, someone who fell to the temptation of hatred and revenge would.... would.....~

== BNALIA~I've heard some refer to you as Lady Aribeth. Do you hold a title of nobility?~

== BNALIA~So you were born a commoner?~
== BNWARIBE~I am still a commoner. Why, is that important?~

== BNWARIBE~I do seek to help whenever I am able, but does my station matter? Common born or nobility, as long as one seeks to do good, does your origin truly matter?~
== BNALIA~Well...no.~
== BNWARIBE~If I may ask you a question? Why are you so fixated on your own status as a noble? Is it out of a sense of guilt?~
== BNWARIBE~I've heard you repeatedly comment upon how you as a noble have left your comfortable life and helped the common folk.~
== BNWARIBE~For what reason do you feel the need to constantly remind others of your benevolence? Can you not simply just do your works anonymously?~
== BNWARIBE~Are you seeking praise? Or do you seek to rub your high minded ideals in the faces of your peers?~
== BNALIA~NO!! It's not like that!~

== BNWARIBE~As you asked, I will answer anyhow. Yes. I do feel remorse for some of my actions.~
== BNWARIBE~I was blinded by hate and revenge and I lost sight of some things of which I should not have.~
== BVICONI~So you are weak after all. If you had been strong, you would have owned the atrocities committed in your name and relished in the blood that you shed.~
== BNWARIBE~Except that person was not who I am. I was never a conqueror. I was just someone who lost a beloved and lashed out in pain and anger.~
